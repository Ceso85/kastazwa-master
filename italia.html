            <p>Here is just a sequence of postcards from my country that I collected while being there mostly with my father.
            We both like being on the road. We both like look around and being constantly on the move. For some reason during my life I was able 
            to gather more experience then he did, which I find extremely unfair. I tried my best in order to feel the gap and despite the time left we had together 
            was not much, here are the memories I collected.</p>

            <p>Liguria 2019. First time in life I managed to swim in the sea with him. I was taken directly from the airport and we drove to Varazze, where
            we were welcomed from an old friendly italian lady that after having checked us in, showed us the room and went to bed.
            During this trip and after years since I moved abroad I noticed that I started to feel like a foreigner in my own country and have difficulties in familiarising with that feeling.
            During that holiday we spent sometime walking around the town and looking at boats of different size and shapes wondering about how the life of a boat owner could be.
            I guess we both never really cared about owning a boat but I guess it could be interesting to live one day of the life of a boat owner and travel on water instead that on land.</p>

            <p>Toscany 2021. After the pandemic we managed to take another little drive down through the country, the last one together as far as I remember.
            We've got lost in the countryside to reappear exactly where we were suppose to. Montescudaio and the sunset, Cecina, the fritto misto, swimming back and forth,
            sharing a bed like we were comrades. I wish we had more of this and less of the rest but life runs so fast and there is nothing we can do about it.
            Along with us came the brilliant John Cheever, swim after swim I also felt I lost the track of time and once I came back where I am from everything was gone.
            Human condition can change drastically with the years, without you even being able to notice it, till the time you feel naked, poor and misunderstood.
            I guess the only thing left to do in this case is to keep swimming on without looking back.</p>
            
            <p>Abruzzo 2022. Still on the road but this time heading to a different direction with a different travel buddy. Lizette and I went back to my beloved Emilia-Romagna and for the first time I had the chance to
            see how wild are certain parts of Italy. Driving through the colli Bolognesi, down to the Abetone and to the appennino tosco-emiliano. Swimming in mountain lakes, down to Perugia, Castelluccio and Norcia.
            Reaching the Gran Sasso di Abruzzo for the last night in the tent and driving back the next day through wild horses and wonderful rocky mountains.
            Being woken up in the middle of the night by the barking dog of the campsite where we were staying, hearing a weird noise coming from a bush behind our tent that did not let us sleep,
            my heart was beating faster and faster, my fear towards wild animals (bears) didn't let me move and we just waited for an endless amount of time before the day came.<p>
