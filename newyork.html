                <p>I visited London the first time the year I turned 20 in my first trip outside my homeland and the surroundings, fascinated by the lifestyle, the language (that back in the days I still had to learn),
                the culture and the music of the capital of England and I suddenly felt like home at the point that I decided to go back to the UK 5 years after, in order to do my exchange year of studies with the university of Bath.
                This year I am doubling up with the age and there was another city in the anglo-american world (someone calls it west) that I could not wait to experience and therefore I went, standing speechless between the shining billboards
                of Times Square or assisting (still speechless) to the Gospel ceremonies of Harlem, hopping between flee-markets, street-markets, stock-markets, abstract art, jazz bars and the biggest amount of steel that I haven't see in a while, New York city, here we come!</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Random facts in History</h5>

                <p>New York city, the former New Amsterdam, the most populous and densely populated city of the United States, was settled by the Dutch in 1608 and became New Amsterdam in 1624. 
                The year after, the construction of a citadel have started in what is nowadays part of the actual southern Manhattan up to the actual Wall street.
                Subsequently the settlement was bought by the Dutch West India company and in 1667 the area went under British control, since the Dutch decided to keep the colony of Suriname instead, 
                so they left the city to the English. and that is when New Amsterdam became New York. In the XVIII century the island gained importance, mostly because of its strategical position for trade, 
                including slaves trade. The following years were troubled because NY was involved in the civil war between the Sons of Liberty ("right to the colonist and no taxation") and the British troops 
                and soon afterwards the city suffered a great fire that burned almost a quarter of it. After the revolution, New York became capital city and saw a massive population expansion. 
                1827 was finally the  year  of the complete abolition of slavery and during the same century, the city saw a massive immigration of European population, making it a large hub for culture and literature 
                and the hometown of some of the most famous american writers like Irving Washington, Edgar Allan Poe and Hermann Melville. At the beginning of XX century, the city was also the main destination of the great migration, 
                that saw six millions of African Americans moving from south to north making it the most populous urbanised area in the early 20's.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">III. Sleepy Hollow & Washington Irvin</h5>

                <p>The day I decided to move out of the city to head to Niagara waterfalls 
                but subsequently changed my destination because of budget reasons (damn it! It is always about budget), 
                it was the day I found out about the nice little town of Sleepy Hollow and thought that the timeless 
                Marilyn Monroe (Niagara, Henry Hathaway, 1953) will sadly still have to wait for me to come there. 
                On my list I marked I wanted to leave NYC at least for a day and dive a little bit into the nature since 
                one of the things (and maybe the only thing) I struggled with while being there was the lack of forests 
                due to the fact that New York is such a huge urban sprawl. Most of you might be familiar with the name 
                Sleepy Hollow because of a movie about a headless horseman shot by Tim Burton and released in 1999 but 
                the story actually comes from sir Washington Irving, one of the first New York writers who made success 
                in Europe and also the one who named NY "Gotham city" and indirectly made it the location of the well known Batman comics
                and movie series. Sleepy Hollow is also the location of the nowadays harmonic site of Philipsburg Manor, a little colonial house who was built 
                in 1750 and served for the economy of the Philipse family. From an external perspective the place looks like a nice little 
                holiday house (sadly during my visit in SH it was closed to visitors) in the middle of the nature despite of being operated 
                by enslaved Africans back in time, with the Philipse family being one the biggest slave-holdings in New England.</p>
