                <p>I visited London the first time the year I turned 20 in my first trip outside my homeland and the surroundings, fascinated by the lifestyle, the language (that back in the days I still had to learn),
                the culture and the music of the capital of England and I suddenly felt like home at the point that I decided to go back to the UK 5 years after, in order to do my exchange year of studies with the university of Bath.
                This year I am doubling up with the age and there was another city in the anglo-american world (someone calls it west) that I could not wait to experience and therefore I went, standing speechless between the shining billboards
                of Times Square or assisting (still speechless) to the Gospel ceremonies of Harlem, hopping between flee-markets, street-markets, stock-markets, abstract art, jazz bars and the biggest amount of steel that I haven't see in a while, New York city, here we come!</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Random facts in History</h5>

                <p>New York city, the former New Amsterdam, the most populous and densely populated city of the United States, was settled by the Dutch in 1608 and became New Amsterdam in 1624. 
                The year after, the construction of a citadel have started in what is nowadays part of the actual southern Manhattan up to the actual Wall street.
                Subsequently the settlement was bought by the Dutch West India company and in 1667 the area went under British control, since the Dutch decided to keep the colony of Suriname instead, 
                so they left the city to the English. and that is when New Amsterdam became New York. In the XVIII century the island gained importance, mostly because of its strategical position for trade, 
                including slaves trade. The following years were troubled because NY was involved in the civil war between the Sons of Liberty ("right to the colonist and no taxation") and the British troops 
                and soon afterwards the city suffered a great fire that burned almost a quarter of it. After the revolution, New York became capital city and saw a massive population expansion. 
                1827 was finally the  year  of the complete abolition of slavery and during the same century, the city saw a massive immigration of European population, making it a large hub for culture and literature 
                and the hometown of some of the most famous american writers like Irving Washington, Edgar Allan Poe and Hermann Melville. At the beginning of XX century, the city was also the main destination of the great migration, 
                that saw six millions of African Americans moving from south to north making it the most populous urbanised area in the early 20's.</p>
