                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

                <p>I visited London the first time the year I turned 20 in my first trip outside my homeland and the surroundings, fascinated by the lifestyle, the language (that back in the days I still had to learn),
                the culture and the music of the capital of England and I suddenly felt like home at the point that I decided to go back to the UK 5 years after, in order to do my exchange year of studies with the university of Bath.
                This year I am doubling up with the age and there was another city in the anglo-american world (someone calls it west) that I couldn't wait to experience called <b>New York</b> and therefore I went there, standing speechless between the shining billboards
                of Times Square or assisting (still speechless) to the Gospel ceremonies of Harlem, hopping between flee-markets, street-markets, stock-markets, abstract art, jazz bars and the biggest amount of steel that I haven't see in a while, New York city, here we come!</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Random facts in History</h5>

                <p>New York city, the former New Amsterdam, the most populous and densely populated city of the United States, was settled by the <b>Dutch</b> in 1608 and became New Amsterdam in 1624. 
                The year after, the construction of a citadel have started in what is nowadays part of the actual southern Manhattan up to the actual Wall street.
                Subsequently the settlement was bought by the Dutch West India company and in 1667 the area went under British control, since the Dutch decided to keep the colony of Suriname instead, 
                so they left the city to the English. and that is when New Amsterdam became New York. In the XVIII century the island gained importance, mostly because of its strategical position for trade, 
                including slaves trade. The following years were troubled because NY was involved in the civil war between the Sons of Liberty ("right to the colonist and no taxation") and the British troops 
                and soon afterwards the city suffered a great fire that burned almost a quarter of it. After the revolution, New York became capital city and saw a massive population expansion. 
                1827 was finally the  year  of the complete abolition of slavery and during the same century, the city saw a massive immigration of European population, making it a large hub for culture and literature 
                and the hometown of some of the most famous american writers like Irving Washington, Edgar Allan Poe and Hermann Melville. At the beginning of XX century, the city was also the main destination of the great migration, 
                that saw six millions of African Americans moving from south to north making it the most populous urbanised area in the early 20's.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">III. Sleepy Hollow & Washington Irvin</h5>

                <p>The day I decided to move out of the city to head to Niagara waterfalls 
                but subsequently changed my destination because of budget reasons (damn it! It is always about budget), 
                it was the day I found out about the nice little town of <b>Sleepy Hollow</b> and thought that the timeless 
                Marilyn Monroe (Niagara, Henry Hathaway, 1953) sadly will still have to wait for me to come there. 
                On my list I marked I wanted to leave NYC at least for a day and dive a little bit into the nature since 
                one of the things (and maybe the only thing) I struggled with while being there was the lack of forests 
                due to the fact that New York is such a huge urban sprawl. Most of you might be familiar with the name 
                Sleepy Hollow because of a movie about a headless horseman shot by Tim Burton and released in 1999 but 
                the story actually comes from sir <b>Washington Irving</b>, one of the first New York writers who made success 
                in Europe and also the one who named NY <b>Gotham city</b> and indirectly made it the location of the well known Batman comics
                and movie series. Sleepy Hollow is also the location of the nowadays harmonic site of <b>Philipsburg Manor</b>, a little colonial house built 
                in 1750 that served for the economy of the Philipse family. From an external perspective the place looks like a nice little 
                holiday house (sadly during my visit in SH it was closed to visitors) in the middle of the nature despite of formerly being operated 
                by enslaved Africans, with the Philipse family being one the biggest slave-holdings in New England.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">IV. Edgar Allan Poe in the Bronx</h5>

                <p><b>Bronx</b> is one of the most legendary part of NYC and also one of the less recommendable apparently, although the situation seems 
                to have improved during the years and nowadays most of people say that the area is generally quite safe. We wanted to have a Bronx 
                experience at least for one day while being in New York and before we went there we looked up and found a bunch of interest places 
                to check out. One of the most interesting one, it was the house where <b>Edgar Allan Poe</b> lived between 1846 and 1849, the so called 
                "Poe cottage". The house was rented by Poe and was chosen by the author as a place where the fresh air of the former rural neighbourhood 
                could help curing his wife health while she was suffering of tuberculosis.  The place unfortunately turned out to be the house were Poe's 
                wife passed away, leaving the author with a certain fascination about the theme of "death of a beautiful woman" which became recurrent in his works. 
                Afterwards a park was built around the house and the area also became well-known as a site where lots of social events happened.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">V. Proibizionism and the speak easy bars</h5>

                <p>I was not very familiar with the term of <b>speak easy</b> before visiting NYC but in order to explain what a speak easy is, it is important 
                to mention the prohibition era that affected the United States from 1920 to 1933. <b>Prohibition era</b> was a time when the production, 
                the distribution and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was forbidden in order to cure America from the "alcohol plague" that according 
                to many was the cause of numerous health and social issues. Society was more or less divided on the topic, although the XVIII amendment finally 
                approved it and made it a law that lasted until 1933.
                The legend says that speak easy bars always existed, although the name was given in the area around Pittsburgh in the 1880s. Despite the poor quality 
                of the alcohol served, speakeasy culture became very popular and profitable in the 1920s and the number of bars raised during this time skyrocketed.
                The evening we decided to head to <b>"The Back Room"</b> (apparently one of the only two speakeasies still open in NY that were operating during prohibitionism), 
                it was a heavy raining night and the streets we will walking past somehow recalled of some of Leonard Cohen songs. Once we reached the bar, located 
                in the courtyard of a generic building, luckily we did not have to struggle to much to find the entrance. Normally in order to enter a speak easy, you will 
                need to provide a proof of entry, most of the time <b>a password</b> or a secret word but this time it was not required. The bar pretty much looks like a standard 
                lounge bar and by the time we were there, the attendance was quite regular and overall what catches the eye the most, it is the fact that drinks are still 
                served in <b>coffee cups</b>, same as it used to be back in the days in order to hide the consumption of alcohol from police officers.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">VI. James Baldwin and the Harlem reinassance</h5>

                <p>Everything started with <b>the great migration</b> and the fascination that migrations generally have on myself.
                Imagine a huge number of people, approximately around six millions, that in a matter of 60 years, migrates from the south east to the northern 
                and western part of the United States. The issues and the struggles they faced have been told by many and amongst all I would like to mention a movie called 
                "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940, John Ford) taken by the same novel from John Steinbeck.
                <b>Harlem Renaissance</b> was mostly a movement based on civil rights and had a good connection with the city of Paris, where lots of black immigrants from the Caribbean 
                area found the movement appealing and related to their ideals.
                Funny enough to think about Harlem as a suburb for white middle and upper class people at the end of the XIX century and becoming in the first quarter of the XX century 
                the area with the highest number of black people in the world.
                Between those people there is one is particular that is still popular nowadays and definitely left a mark in modern literature and is name is <b>James Baldwin</b>.
                Baldwin was born in Harlem and his mother was one of those millions of people who fled the south during the times I mentioned above and he never had the chance to know 
                about his biological father. Baldwin lived in Harlem till when World War II broke out, indirectly marking the end of Harlem renaissance and afterwards he moved to Greenwich Village 
                first and Paris afterwards. He was known for his libertine lifestyle and it seems that one of the reasons he gave about his choice of leaving New York was the hostility he felt 
                in the city towards his sexual habits, coming mostly from Calvinism. He started to gain celebrity after his first novel <i>Go and tell the Mountain (1953)</i> and by the 60s 
                he was a prominent figure as a civil right activist.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">VII. Grant Wood</h5>

                <p>According to T.S.Eliot, one of a certain number of permanent conditions "in the absence of which no higher culture can be expected" is <b>regionalism</b>. During the great depression regionalism 
                became the status quo in american painting and <b>Grant Wood</b> (together with Thomas Hart Benton and John Steuart Curry) the main actor, with his power to depict the rural routine of american <b>Midwest</b> 
                of a country in search of a clear identity during one of the hardest time since its independence. As many other american artists did, the young Wood made regular trips to Europe, in order to study modern 
                paintings and movements as Impressionism and post Impressionism although he was mostly influenced from a Dutch painter from the XV century, Jan van Eyck. <i>American Gothic (1930)</i> is a painting showing two characters, 
                a man (his dentist) and a woman (his sister) standing next to each other. It is an iconic example of american rejection of European artistic standard and if we want, a sort of an outdated "make America great" manifesto, 
                with its seriousness and devotional attachment to manual labour, religion and puritanism which to be fair, can almost be found in every other rural and small town reality under different forms in most of the countries in the world.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">VIII. Pollock and the CIA</h5>

                <p>The first time I noticed the strong emphasis that the CIA put on painting back in the cold war era, I was visiting the Neue Galerie in Berlin and I noticed that the curators tried to underline the topic, dividing the hall in two parts, 
                one showing american avantgarde abstract painting and the other the more soviet realistic approach to the topic, in order to display how back in the days painting was seen as a way that the US government used to stand for freedom, individualism, 
                expression and innovation that were seen as values of the american societies in contrast with the ideological, state-controlled, soviet vision. <b>Jackson Pollock</b> was one between the artists who was indirectly chosen (together with Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, 
                Lee Krasner and some others) to support this view of the world and for many years became the prominent figure in american painting. Jackson Pollock wouldn't have become so famous without <b>Clement Greenberg</b>, an american art-critic, known for his essay 
                on avant-garde and kitsch who contributed to Pollock's fame in his essay called <i>American-type painting (1955)</i>. Personally I find Pollock very inspiring for questioning time and space ("I enjoy working on a large canvas, I feel more at home, more at ease in a big area"), 
                for giving painting a sort of metaphysical perspective and for making it a sort of performing art, while standing on the huge canvas with is lighted cigarette and splashing it with rough colorful brushstrokes that can mean everything and nothing at the same time but 
                that are definitely perfect in their capacity of picturing restlessness and non conformism.</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">IX. Faulkner and Steinback</h5>

                <p><b>Faulkner vs. Steinbeck</b> in my very modest view can be the question between who is the biggest american writer of the XX century or at least the most acclaimed one. It looks like the distinction that Clement Greenberg made between avantgarde and kitsch can also be applied 
                on modern literature, where William Faulkner is the avantgarde writer, with his long and complex sentences, stream of consciousness and jumps back and forward in time and space. A place like <b>Yoknapatawpha</b> (inspired on Lafayette county, Mississippi, originally a Chickasaw land) 
                could probably exist only in Faulkner's mind, while John Steinbeck is supposed to be the realist, the one that has a "less attractive" view, mostly focusing on grounded working class characters and barely leaving his "comfort zone". The two are both worldwide famous writers and 
                Nobel prize winners and both of them tried to depict their native country mostly focusing on social and economical issues, in a very anthropological way that made them so much appreciated. There is no real answer to the question since both writers as to be taken in contrast 
                to each other but what it is certain is that both of them gave a huge contribution to american literature.</p>
