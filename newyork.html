                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

                <p>I visited London the first time the year I turned 20 in my first trip outside my homeland and the surroundings, fascinated by the lifestyle, the language (that back in the days I still had to learn),
                the culture and the music of the capital of England and I suddenly felt like home at the point that I decided to go back to the UK 5 years after, in order to do my exchange year of studies with the university of Bath.
                This year I am doubling up with the age and there was another city in the anglo-american world (someone calls it west) that I could not wait to experience and therefore I went, standing speechless between the shining billboards
                of Times Square or assisting (still speechless) to the Gospel ceremonies of Harlem, hopping between flee-markets, street-markets, stock-markets, abstract art, jazz bars and the biggest amount of steel that I haven't see in a while, New York city, here we come!</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Random facts in History</h5>

                <p>New York city, the former New Amsterdam, the most populous and densely populated city of the United States, was settled by the Dutch in 1608 and became New Amsterdam in 1624. 
                The year after, the construction of a citadel have started in what is nowadays part of the actual southern Manhattan up to the actual Wall street.
                Subsequently the settlement was bought by the Dutch West India company and in 1667 the area went under British control, since the Dutch decided to keep the colony of Suriname instead, 
                so they left the city to the English. and that is when New Amsterdam became New York. In the XVIII century the island gained importance, mostly because of its strategical position for trade, 
                including slaves trade. The following years were troubled because NY was involved in the civil war between the Sons of Liberty ("right to the colonist and no taxation") and the British troops 
                and soon afterwards the city suffered a great fire that burned almost a quarter of it. After the revolution, New York became capital city and saw a massive population expansion. 
                1827 was finally the  year  of the complete abolition of slavery and during the same century, the city saw a massive immigration of European population, making it a large hub for culture and literature 
                and the hometown of some of the most famous american writers like Irving Washington, Edgar Allan Poe and Hermann Melville. At the beginning of XX century, the city was also the main destination of the great migration, 
                that saw six millions of African Americans moving from south to north making it the most populous urbanised area in the early 20's.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">III. Sleepy Hollow & Washington Irvin</h5>

                <p>The day I decided to move out of the city to head to Niagara waterfalls 
                but subsequently changed my destination because of budget reasons (damn it! It is always about budget), 
                it was the day I found out about the nice little town of Sleepy Hollow and thought that the timeless 
                Marilyn Monroe (Niagara, Henry Hathaway, 1953) will sadly still have to wait for me to come there. 
                On my list I marked I wanted to leave NYC at least for a day and dive a little bit into the nature since 
                one of the things (and maybe the only thing) I struggled with while being there was the lack of forests 
                due to the fact that New York is such a huge urban sprawl. Most of you might be familiar with the name 
                Sleepy Hollow because of a movie about a headless horseman shot by Tim Burton and released in 1999 but 
                the story actually comes from sir Washington Irving, one of the first New York writers who made success 
                in Europe and also the one who named NY "Gotham city" and indirectly made it the location of the well known Batman comics
                and movie series. Sleepy Hollow is also the location of the nowadays harmonic site of Philipsburg Manor, a little colonial house who was built 
                in 1750 and served for the economy of the Philipse family. From an external perspective the place looks like a nice little 
                holiday house (sadly during my visit in SH it was closed to visitors) in the middle of the nature despite of being operated 
                by enslaved Africans back in time, with the Philipse family being one the biggest slave-holdings in New England.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">IV. Edgar Allan Poe in the Bronx</h5>

                <p>Bronx is one of the most legendary part of NYC and also one of the less recommendable apparently, although the situation seems 
                to have improved during the years and nowadays most of people say that the area is generally quite safe. We wanted to have a Bronx 
                experience at least for one day while being in New York and before we went there we looked up and found a bunch of interest places 
                to check out. One of the most interesting one, it was the house where Edgar Allan Poe lived between 1846 and 1849, the so called 
                "Poe cottage". The house was rented by Poe in and was chosen by the author as a place where the fresh air of the former rural neighbourhood 
                could help curing his wife health while she was suffering of tuberculosis.  The place unfortunately turned out to be the house were Poe's 
                wife passed away, leaving the author with a certain fascination about the theme of "death of a beautiful woman" which became recurrent in his works. 
                Afterwards a park was built around the house and the area also became well-known as a site where lots of social events happened.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">V. Proibizionism and the speak easy bars</h5>

                <p>I was not very familiar with the term of "speak easy" before visiting NYC but in order to explain what a speakeasy is, it is important 
                to mention the prohibition era that affected the United States from 1920 to 1933. Prohibition era was a period in time when the production, 
                the distribution and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was forbidden in order to cure America from the "alcohol plague" that according 
                to many, was the cause of numerous health and social issues. Society was more or less divided on the topic, although the XVIII amendment finally 
                approved it and made it a law that lasted until 1933.
                The legend says that speak easy bars always existed, although the name was given in the area around Pittsburgh in the 1880s. Despite the poor quality 
                of the alcohol served, speakeasy culture became very popular and profitable in the 1920s and the number of bars raised during this time.
                The evening we decided to head to "The Back Room" (apparently one of the only two speakeasies still open in NY that were operating during prohibitionism), 
                it was a heavy raining night and the streets we will walking past somehow recalled me of some of Leonard Cohen songs. Once we reached the bar located 
                in the courtyard of a generic building, luckily we did not have to struggle to much to find the entrance. Normally in order to enter a speak easy, you will 
                need to provide a proof of entry, most of the time a password or a secret word but this time it was not required. The bar pretty much looks like a standard 
                lounge bar and by the time we were there, the attendance was quite regular and overall what catches the eye the most, it is the fact that drinks are still 
                served in coffee cups, same as it used to be back in the days in order to hide the consumption of alcohol from police officers.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;"><li>VI. James Baldwin and the Harlem reinassance</li></h5>

                <p>Everything started with the great migration and the fascination that migrations generally have on me.
                Imagine a huge number of people, approximately around six millions, that in a matter of 60 years, migrates from the south east to the northern 
                and western part of the United States. The issues and the struggles they faced have been told by many and amongst all I would like to mention a movie called 
                "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940, John Ford) taken by the same novel from John Steinbeck.
                Harlem Renaissance was mostly a movement based on civil rights and had a good connection with the city of Paris, where lots of black immigrants from the Caribbean 
                area found the movement appealing and related to their ideals.
                Funny enough to think about Harlem as a suburb for white middle and upper class people at the end of the XIX century and becoming in the first quarter of the XX century 
                the area with the highest number of black people in the world.
                Between those people there is one is particular that is still popular nowadays and definitely left a mark in modern literature and is name is James Baldwin.
                Baldwin was born in Harlem and his mother was one of those millions of people who fled the south during the times I mentioned above and he never had the chance to know 
                about his biological father. Baldwin lived in Harlem till when world war II broke out, indirectly marking the end of Harlem renaissance and afterwards he moved to Greenwich Village 
                first and to Paris afterwards. He was known for his libertine lifestyle and it seems that one of the reasons he gave about his choice of leaving New York was the hostility he felt 
                in the city towards his sexual habits, coming mostly from Calvinism. He started to gain celebrity after his first novel "Go and tell the Mountain" that he wrote in 1953 and by the 60s 
                he was a prominent figure as a civil right activist.</p>
