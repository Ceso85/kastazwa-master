            <p>They say there are 5 parts of <b>Colombia</b> that deserve to be seen: <i>la costa</i>, <i>la sierra</i>, <i>la selva</i>, <i>il Pacifico</i> and of course the capital <b>Bogotá</b>.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately (or fortunately) in my 40 days in the country I couldn't do it all but I managed to see three of those parts and I had a taste of sierra during my last 
            weeks in the country, when all the city life was gone and I able to rest for a few days in <b>Putamayo</b>, in a town called <b>Mocoa</b> where I shared some time with 
            Ayahuasca lovers, that were there mostly to enjoy new sensorial experience, heal, find themselves and go back on their own right lifepath.</p>

            <p>But first comes Bogotá. I only had a brief visit of the capital city, because the jetlag and the post flight-fatigue left an inner voice that told me to go elsewhere and so I did, 
            but there are a few things in the city that definitely deserve to be checked out. One is the <i>barrio</i> of <b>La Candelaria</b> with its street-life, its cosmopolitan food culture, street art and nice cafés.
            The place is relatively safe and well located (close to the city center) and for the days I was there I felt somehow comfortable and happy to start my journey from there.
            Nearby I could recommend the <b>Botero</b> collection, the biggest colombian collection of art of the most iconic colombian painter, who definitely came up during different parts of my trip (especially in Medellín, 
            his birthplace). Also the mountain of <b>Montserrate</b>, the highest mountain in the city over 3000m, with his great city view, could be seen on a nice day trip.
            The name comes from a catalan word that means "serrated mountain" and it recalls of another place with the same name that I visited during my year in Barcelona, also called Montserrat.</p>

            <p>Heading north towards the <i>costa</i>, I had the chance to stop in one of the so called <i>pueblos mágicos</i>, those town who are considered somehow magical for keeping its essence,
            its tradition and its original architecture and historical center. The town is in state of <b>Santander</b> and it is called <b>Barichara</b> and from there I started my hike to the small and almost
            inhabited town of Guané. This path was renewed and reconstructed thanks to the effort of a german wanderer called <b>Geo von Lengerke</b>, who came to Colombia in the middle of the XIX century in order to start a new
            life, bringing his engineering skills, his piano and apparently some european wines.</p>

            <p>Once I reached the carribean coast of Colombia I have to say I had mixed feelings. On one side I was amazed by the endless loop of afro-carribean rhythms, the colorful outfits of the locals who try to make a living in an environment
            who has been more and more colonized by mass turism (of course, it's the <i>Caribe</i>, you will say) and from the beautiful beaches and national parks (<b>Tayrona</b> is the highlight) but on the other hand I was not particulary
            impressed by the cities <b>Santa Marta</b> and <b>Cartagena</b>, although the last one has a beautiful colonial historical center and a very hype-former-working-class district famous for its easy going lifestyle, that used to be very unsafe back in the days but in the recent years became more
            popular and safe also because of gentrification called <b>Getsemaní</b>, that surely deserves a visit.</p>

            <img src="images\colombia_3.jpg" alt="colombia_3" class="my-5 blog">

            <p>After the time I spent on the coast, I moved south again. The highlights of this part of the trip were two main cities <b>Medellín</b> and <b>Cali</b>, the beautiful <b>Valle de Cocora</b> and the coffee farms of the <b>Eje cafetero.</b>
            Medellín was the business center of the Colombian <i>cartel</i> back in the '80 and some of the district like <b>Comuna 13</b> were definitely no-go areas due to the high presence of various kind of criminal gangs and drug dealers.
            Nowadays things have changed and the place can be visited. The huge number of plasterless houses makes Comuna 13 look like a favela but despite the high number of turists, the place has its own charm and surprisingly some people may notice that <b>Pablo Escobar</b>,
            despite becoming a pop icon years after his death, is seen nowadays more as a criminal than as a hero by most of colombians.</p>

            <p>Cali is the city of salsa and that's the city where I had the chance to learn about some of the most influential and iconic musicians who contributed to make the genre world-wide famous.
            Despite of the fact that he was born in Puerto Rico, I was fascinated in particular by the figure of <b>Hector Lavoe</b>, <i>"el cantante de los cantantes"</i> by his voice and by his controversial and tragical life.</p>

            <p>Leaving Colombia after such a short amount of time was an hard choice but I know I will be back one day soon. On the way out of the country, which I travelled entirely using public transportation as I normally do when I visit a country,
            I had the chance to go on one of the south american most dangerous road called <i>el trampolín del diablo</i>, literally "the devil's trampoline" that connects Mocoa to Pasto, leaving the jungle and heading up on the mountain.
            The road is a one lane road that runs on the mountain like a silent snake. It goes along the cliff without any kind of protection and it is open to literally every kind of vehicles, cars, buses, trucks and everything else. There are often accidents reported
            on this road and unfortunately lots of fatalities occured in the past. I wasn't aware I was going to go on this road until the day before I took it and to be honest I was not particulary enthusiasted about the idea but now that I can share the story, I am happy to have one more tick on my checklist.</p>

            <p>The next country where I was going on this journey, it was going to be Ecuador. The way I was almost rejected when I tried to enter the country was unreal but I am going to talk about it in the next section.</p>
