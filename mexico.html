            <p>This is definitely one of those I have planned and dreamt for so long 
            that once I stepped on the carpet or the airplane I felt almost like I could't believe it.
            To be honest, Mexico is a pop dream for many of us, since its sandy beaches and cloudy and bright skies
            have been the scenario of many stories covering the last centuries of literature, cinema and music.</p>

            <p>I decided that for this trip, I would bring along with me the great Malcolm Lowry and his messy masterpiece
            "Under the Vulcano" since before leaving, I already sympatised for the guy and his wandering madness between
            Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl.</p>

            <p>Part of the concept of the album "Compulsive Seeking" (the ode to the number twelve, like the chapters of the book,
            like the hours in a day and the months in a year) and the song Calle Nicaragua are definitely inspired from Malcolm
            dark journey through his fragile self and the external tropical danger.</p>

            <p>Regarding my own journey, the goal I set for myself, was to escape as soon as I could a certain kind of mass tourism
            and focusing more on casual travellers and adventurers, some of them I found very impressive
            in their committment to challenge the 'mala', the heat, the spicyness, 
            and most of all the wild life of the country
            in order to make something out of their trip.</p>
