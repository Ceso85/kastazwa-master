            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

            <p><b>México</b> is one trip I planned and dreamt for so long 
            that once I was on the airplane I felt almost like I could not believe that it was happening.
            The destination is a dream for many: sandy beaches, a cloudy bright sky and a certain excitement
            related mostly to danger and mob in particular have been the scenario of many stories covering the 
            last centuries of literature, cinema and music.</p>

            <p>For the occasion I brought along with me the great <b>Malcolm Lowry</b> and his alcoholic madness included
            in a book called <b>"Under the Vulcano"</b>. I found out about the guy just a few weeks before leaving and 
            his wandering between <b>Popocatepetl</b> and <b>Iztaccihuatl</b> definitely draw my attention.</p>

            <p>I was on a bus journey down to <b>Puebla</b> still dealing with the jetlag the first time I saw Iztaccihuatl after having spent the first 4/5
            days in <b>México City</b> and the view was astonishing. Despite of losing that cosiness
            that México City with all its dangerous shadows walking in the dark was able to give me,
            I felt a certain familiarity with the surrounding vulcanic region  and I also realised I was entering chapter II of my own journey. 
            Seeing a smoking vulcano makes you feel like you should not rely too much
            on your comfort since things in life can change quickly and makes you learn how important is for oneself to adapt to situations
            that can happen on the road at any time.</p>

            <p>Part of the concept of my last work "Compulsive Seeking" (the recall to number twelve, like the chapters in the book,
            the hours in a day and the months in a year) and the song Calle Nicaragua are definitely inspired from Malcolm
            dark journey through his fragile self and the external tropical danger.</p>

            <p>Regarding my own journey, the goal I set for myself was to escape as soon as I could a certain kind of mass tourism
            and focusing more on casual travellers and adventurers, some of them I found very impressive
            in their committment to challenge the 'mala', the heat, the spicyness, and most of all the wild life of the country
            in order to make something real out of their trip.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Edward James</h5>

            <p><b>Edward James</b> is an eccentric figure. Born in England from an aristocratic family, he always followed his dreams
            and lived somehow an extraordinary life. His devoted interest for art in general (he was a poet and a painter himself) made him
            support surrealism and financing some of its most famous interpreters like Salvador Dalí.</p>

            <p>James was a visionary himself and somehow had an utopistic vision in his mind: a garden of Eden.
            He found the right spot to fulfill his ambition 7 hours driving north of México city in a place called <b>Las Pozas</b>,
            based in a subtropical rainforest in the Sierra Gorda.</p>

            <p>The place took a while to be built. It started in 1949 to be finished (more or less) in 1984, the year of his death.
            The attention to details and the focus on tropicalism are the things that would mostly catch the attention
            of the visitors.</p>
