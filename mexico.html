            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

            <p><b>México</b> is one trip I planned and dreamt for so long 
            that once I was on the airplane I felt almost like I could not believe that it was happening.
            The destination is a dream for many: sandy beaches, a cloudy bright sky and a certain excitement
            related mostly to danger and mob in particular have been the scenario of many stories covering the 
            last centuries of literature, cinema and music.</p>

            <p>For the occasion I brought along with me the great <b>Malcolm Lowry</b> and his alcoholic madness included
            in a book called <b>"Under the Vulcano"</b>. I found out about the guy just a few weeks before leaving and 
            his wandering between <b>Popocatepetl</b> and <b>Iztaccihuatl</b> definitely draw my attention.</p>

            <p>I was on a bus journey down to <b>Puebla</b> still dealing with the jetlag the first time I saw Iztaccihuatl after having spent the first 4/5
            days in <b>México City</b> and the view was astonishing. Despite of losing that cosiness
            that México City with all its dangerous shadows walking in the dark was able to give me,
            I felt a certain familiarity with the surrounding vulcanic region  and I also realised I was entering chapter II of my own journey. 
            Seeing a smoking vulcano makes you feel like you should not rely too much
            on your comfort since things in life can change quickly and makes you learn how important is for oneself to adapt to situations
            that can happen on the road at any time.</p>

            <p>Part of the concept of my last work "Compulsive Seeking" (the recall to number twelve, like the chapters in the book,
            the hours in a day and the months in a year) and the song Calle Nicaragua are definitely inspired from Malcolm
            dark journey through his fragile self and the external tropical danger.</p>

            <p>Regarding my own journey, the goal I set for myself was to escape as soon as I could a certain kind of mass tourism
            and focusing more on casual travellers and adventurers, some of them I found very impressive
            in their committment to challenge the 'mala', the heat, the spicyness, and most of all the wild life of the country
            in order to make something real out of their trip.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Edward James</h5>

            <p><b>Edward James</b> is an eccentric figure. Born in England from an aristocratic family, he always followed his dreams
            and lived somehow an extraordinary life. His devoted interest for art in general (he was a poet and a painter himself) made him
            support surrealism and financing some of its most famous interpreters like Salvador Dalí.</p>

            <p>James was a visionary himself and somehow had an utopistic vision in his mind: a garden of Eden.
            He found the right spot to fulfill his ambition 7 hours driving north of México city in a place called <b>Las Pozas</b>,
            based in a subtropical rainforest in the Sierra Gorda.</p>

            <p>The place took a while to be built. It started in 1949 to be finished (more or less) in 1984, the year of his death.
            The attention to details and the focus on tropicalism are the things that would mostly catch the attention
            of the visitors.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">III. Eisenstein: que viva México!</h5>

            <p>When <b>Eisenstein</b> (one of the most influential figures in the Soviet cinema) went to México in 1930, it was mostly to please his interests in
            pre-colonial cultures and Méxican revolution. Both the soviets and the méxican (and I would add the french too)
            have a common history in terms of standing against the power and during those times, México became a fascinating country for lots of
            rebellious artists for its surrealistic environments and the capacity to stand against the power.</p>

            <p>The movie never made it to the pubblic because of lack of investments and some technical issues,
            but the material who has been recorded it is still nowadays available to public and can be seen on 35mm and luckily I had the chance
            to do it at the <i>Arsenal institute for film in Berlin</i>.</p>

            <p>The thematics are various, mostly including death and life and how precolonial México dealt with the topic before
            the arrival of the spanish. The whole concept looked to me a little bit less dramatic in pre-colonial times, the passing of time slows down and people smile innocently.
            Overall the whole shooting transmits a certain tranquility that can not be felt in the next scene showing an audience assisting a <i>corrida de toros</i>.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">IV. The anti-capitalistic slap of Diego Rivera</h5>

            <p>When I entered <b>Palacio de Bellas Artes</b>, a beautiful art nouveau-styled-palais in the historical center of México city near parque Alameda,
            I knew I was going to visit something very big and controversial for the time it was made, the <b>murales</b> of <b>Diego Rivera</b>.</p>

            <p>Walking around the palais I had the time to reflect on how meaningful and shocking the size of a work of art can be, especially when it is meant to be made for
            political purposes, regardless if it is showing a naked big breasted blindfolded woman in chain or a group of people rioting for freedom.
            The most famous <i>murales</i> in the site is probably the one called <b>Man at the Crossroads</b> (1933), commissioned to Rivera by the <i>Rockfeller center</i> with the goal
            of representing ethical and technical evolution, socialism and capitalism. The controversy started when Rivera decided to add an image of Lenin, after the murales was
            labeled as part of an "anti-capitalistic propaganda", replaced and possibly destroyed. Afterwards Rivera decided to repaint it in México, giving it the
            original title.</p>
