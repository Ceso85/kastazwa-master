            <p>It's been 8 years since I haven't been to Portugal and 12 from my first visit, that's why I was very much looking forward coming back one third time
            to see the northern part of the country. Walking the <b>Camino de la costa</b> gave me the chance to see the part that goes from <b>Oporto</b> to a pretty
            small fishing town bordering Spain called <b>Camihna</b>. From there the only way to go to Spain is to jump on a small motor boat and
            cross the <b>Mihno</b> river, for a crossing that lasts only a couple of minutes.</p>

            <p>Once you leave Oporto and the surrounding towns of Matosihnos the rest is pretty much a smooth walk along the ocean on a series of comfortable
            wooden pathways, going through town after town in a sort of magical portuguese realism, made of old careful people that don't speak anything but
            portuguese and are there to greet and support pilgrims in all their needs.</p>

            <p>This corner of Europe has definitely been left back in time and that contributes to give to northern Portugal a certain charm.
            Being autumn the weather was a bit rough, the rain poured down heavily during a good part of the trip and the stormy ocean gave a certain
            romanticism to the whole adventure.</p>

            <p>The dark poetry of <b>Fernando Pessoa</b> came into my mind during those days ("I am nothing. I will never be anything. I couldn't want to be something. 
            Apart from that, I have in me all the dreams in the world.") and I guess his very introspective and almost depressing vision of the human kind must have had something to do with all of this.</p>

            <p>Another remarkable thing that I noticed on the camino were the bridges of <b>Gustave Eiffel</b>. Eiffel was a french civil engineer, mostly famous for the construction of the Eiffel tower,
            a very nationalistic monument aimed to represent french modernity in the World's Fair of 1889. Eiffel is also present in Portugal on a number of different bridges,
            the most famous one is the <b>puente Maria Pía</b>, part of the former railway station that divides the city of Porto from Villa Nova de Gaia but there is another one I had the chance to walk on
            entering Viana do Castelo and one in Camihna.</p>
