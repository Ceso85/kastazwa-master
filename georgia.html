            <h5 id="introduction" style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

            <p><b>Georgia</b> was on my mind for quite a while, at least from 2019 when I went to Ukraine by train just to avoid flying. This time I did fly to Ankara and crossed half of Turkey before finding myself in front 
            of a police-lady at the border control that for some reason started to look skeptically at me and couldn't stop scrolling through the pages of my passport.
            That day was exhausting and the only thing I wanted was to crush on a bed somewhere in the country.
            I knew <b>Batumi</b> was described as a sort of sovietic-Vegas-like kind of city and
            when I found myself looking down from a balcony on the 25th floor with the bright lights of Marriott hotel reflecting on my face and the slaps and the cold 
            breeze of the <b>Black sea</b> waves, I know what that meant.</p>

            <p>The morning after just fresh out of bed I was ready to go. <i>Marshrutka</i> is one of the words you are supposed to know in Georgia. It is a russian word that is the equivalent of what we call van. 
            <i>Marshrutkas</i> take you all around the country relatively fast and cheap and they are easy to find but very uncomfortable. After one of those short journey (3/4 hours in total), I reached <b>Kutaisi</b>, a nice discovery but for me sadly nothing more than a nice dinner 
            with local red wine because time was running fast and I had to leave already the day after. So I rushed to <b>Tbilisi</b>, got there in the evening and had another nice dinner with red wine before finally being able to go up on the Caucasus to see some nature.
            <b>Stepantsminda</b> is a town 1700m on the sea level, 20km far from the border with Russia, home of the some of the most amazing mountains I have ever seen (and I come from a mountain region).</p>

            <p>I started my trail just a few hours before it was getting dark although I was told to not be back after dark, because temperatures are really freezing up there on the mountains. I was sure
            I could still make it and after a while walking in the snow I heard someone screaming at me "Dangerous, be careful". I thought my mind was playing tricks on me but when I looked on my left, I saw a man lying in the snow, unable to move. 
            At first sight I thought it could be a hunter, maybe chasing local bears (I knew that in that area they are quite common) but when he started to ask for help, I slowly headed towards him and asked if he spoke english just to make sure I could interact. 
            The answer was positive and afterwards he simply explained that he got stuck in the snow and couldn't proceed any further. I got him out of that situation and for the next three days I made myself a new travel buddy called Yan, a chinese guy based in Russia,
            busy travelling around and trying his best to put himself into troubles. The guy was a pleasant companion and I am glad we had the chance to spend sometime together and talk about how different it is to leave in Europe or in Russia.
            Those days I was hosted in a very cozy small house, run by a local friendly lady that unfortunately could not speak english, but we tried our best to communicate using modern devices and translators and at the end we 
            managed to entertain each other in the evening and have nice conversations. The day I left Kazbegi, I was heading to <b>Tbilisi</b> once again and officially started my return trip to Europe.</p>

            <p>Back in Tbilisi I had the chance to explore a bit more of the city and its architecture. 
            Tbilisi has a very peculiar style, mixing sovietic blocks of flats with old art-nouveau buildings, 
            wooden balconies and orthodox churches. The city is full of colors and details, every corner is worth a photo and walking around aimlessly is probably the best way to discover it.
            Tbilisi old fortress is reachable with a cable car and it is an amazing spot for sunset. The city is realtively small and welcoming, down in a valley surrounded by nature.
            Even if the style spread all the way until the Black sea, Georgia has its own take on <b>Art Nouveau</b>. The style was here enriched by some national elements
            and materials like wood that gave more of a singolar and diverse approach. In Georgia Art Nouveau also applied to public buildings like schools and hospitals and that to me looks 
            like a wonderful way to create a sort of magical realism and at the same to stick with the soviet standard of that time.
            Art Nouveau was for Georgia also an attempt to match European standards, a sort of tacit consent that started to state what the present and the future of the country is likely to be.</p>
