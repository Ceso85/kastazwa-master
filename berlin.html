        <p>Berlin is the place where I currently live and it has been like that almost for the last ten year.
        It's the city I have chosen for my european come back after one year spent between Australia and south east Asia.
        Obviously why did I move to Berlin is one of the question I get asked the most and although I do not have a clear answer to it,
        I knew that once I moved here it would have been for a while.</p>

        <p>The city as a lot of pro and cons. It's a place that makes you feel comfortable, the cost of living is pretty low compared to the one
        of other european capitals and there is a plenty of interesting people with impressive life stories and different backgrounds all over the place.
        Berlin is a sort of love affair that can not turn into something more, at least for me. It's a sort of "non-lieu" that grew its own identity from the fact
        of not having a clear identity.</p>

        <p>Cultural-wise is absolutely wide and various. Almost every artistic movement can find its own dimension and no matter what you're into,
        you'll find someone into the same things sooner or later around the city. The darkness that cover the city especially during the winter period and the lack
        of light makes of Berlin a place where it is hard to adapt completely, where people pretty often feel lonely and have to find a way to deal with it.</p>

        <p>Berlin definitely helped me to grow as a human being. It gave me all the space I needed and it left me quiet working on what my main interests are.
        In this city there is the most number of life stories I met so far and crazy nights out I ended up doing something completely unexpected only half an hour before</p>
