            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

            <p>Crossing the Atlantic and travelling to America for those who likes music, literature and cinema in particular is always
            a hell of a journey, no matter if you are going to the United States or to Latin America. Some of the things I was mostly looking forward to knowing were the tales of <b>Hernest Hemingway</b>
            and <b>latin jazz</b> music. Seeing the statue of <i>papa</i> Hemingway sitting at the <b>Floridita</b> in <b>La Havana</b>, waiting for one of his specials
            was simply amazing and digging deeper into afro-cuban music and culture was the other reason.</p>

            <p>My time in <b>Cuba</b> was limited and therefore I had to make choices since I couldn't travel all over the island. I decided to fly to <b>Varadero</b> first that despite all of its
            soulless resorts can offer amazing beaches and be enough relaxing for those who have to get rid of the jetlag after a 12 hours flight.
            The next stops afterwards were in order: <b>Cienfuegos</b>, <b>Trinidad</b>, <b>La Havana</b>, <b>Vinales</b>, <b>Matanzas</b> and back to Varadero.</p>

            <p>Cuba and its apparent happy rural everyday life were overall quite inspiring and during my stay there I was able to write a bunch of poems and also some of the songs of the album "For the Time Being", in particular "Guanabana Guajira Hat"
            and "La Revolucíon desde tu Cuerpo".</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. Afro-cubanism</h5>
            
            <p>To make it simple, everything started with <i>Habanera</i>.
            Habanera comes from <i>Contradanse</i>, english country dance music adopeted at the court of France and taken to America, where
            became important and developed in <i>Mambo</i> and <i>Cha-Cha-Cha</i>. Habanera is famous for its rhythm time signature in 2/4 
            with the upbeat falling in the middle of the bar.</p>

            <P>The concept of <b>Clave</b> is fondamental in latin music and that is a concept that comes from the african diaspora. 
            The clave is made of five beats, which can be divided in either 3/2 or 2/3.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">III. Benny Moré que me canta sabroso</h5>
            
            <p><b>Benny Moré</b> <i>"el barbaro del ritmo"</i> is considered one of the most influencial musician of the once-upon-a-time cuban music scene.
            Born  from a family of african origins, he had to struggle with the economical issues of his huge family (18 children) and he was send to work in the fields
            at a young age. Young Benny loved to sing and in his youth was literally singing to anyone he met on his way. He reached celebrity in a more or less casual way, firstly winning a radio competition
            and secondly by joining the "trio Matamaros"due to the fact that the main singer was indisposed for the occasion.
            Moré went touring to México and for some reason became famous abroad before reaching celebrity in his beloved Cuba and within' the years his celebrity
            expanded through all the center America while touring with the "Banda Gigante". His alcoholism was the cause of his early <i>despedida</i> but if you talk to many
            on the island, Benny Moré never really left.</p>
