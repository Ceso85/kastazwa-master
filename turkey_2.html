            <h5 id="i-introduction" style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>
            <p>The second time I went to <b>Turkey</b> after exactly one year from the first time, it was because I felt the need of finishing the journey I started the year before, since I did not have time to visit the remote eastern side of the country, which is culturally and geographically 
            closer to Asia than Europe I would say, where sometimes I had to struggle in order to be understood because english is not widely spoken.
            After having seen the cosmopolitan, modern, huge, international and sometimes intimidating size of Istanbul and the charming, quiet and colourful Safranbolu (the name comes from Saffron, since the city 
            was an important saffron trading place), what was on my list this time was the capital city <b>Ankara</b>, the beautiful desertic area of <b>Cappadocia</b>, the eastern city of <b>Kars</b> and the ancient ruin of <b>Ani</b>, on the border with Armenia.<p>

            <p>On my way to Cappadocia, I decided to set my base in <b>Göreme</b> and that was also the chance to meet other fellow travellers from China and Iran, that reached Cappadocia on different ways, someone hitching and someone biking. Some of those people despite the cold November cappadocian nights and despite the barking, 
            wild and skinny dogs around, decided to camp in the nature and lit a fire for the days they where there. Free-camping is supposed to be forbidden in Turkey but apparently after having talked to them, I had the feeling that generally the police is not very concerned about people sleeping in tents in the middle of nowhere.
            Despite of the fun and the social life I enjoyed while being in Göreme, one thing that I saw and impressed me the most was the underground city of <b>Mazi</b>. </p>

            <h5 id="ii-mazi" style="font-weight: bold;">II. The underground city of Mazi</h5>
            <p>The city is located in Nevşehir and it was built during the early roman period, supposedly by early Christians in order to hide from roman persecutions and it is made of a series of tunnels and rooms going several meters under the ground for about 8 levels.
            The city could host up to 20.000 people, which I personally think it is a crazy amount of people for such a tiny space and it had everything that a small village could need, from kitchens to wineries, from churches to stables for animals that people were very skilled to threat. The air circulation system was also very advanced 
            for that time and it is impressive how people managed to build such a complex structure without the help of modern tools. The city served its purpose for several centuries until the 1920s, when the last inhabitants left it in order to reach the surface again. Early Christians hiding from roman persecutions and Byzantines
            escaping from Mongolian both used Mazi as a shelter.</p>

            <h5 id="iii-dogu" style="font-weight: bold;">III. The Dogu train journey</h5>
            <p>The <b>Dogu-train</b> crossing Turkey from Kayseri to Kars was probably the longest train journey I had in all my life (1am to 8 pm, roughly 19 hours journey).
            The experience is supposed to be once of a lifetime experience according to travel bloggers and other people who did the same route before.
            I have to say that the ride was overall pretty enjoyable and very much into "what locals do" since I haven't met any foreigners doing the same route that night and the following day, but maybe because I did the journey off-season.
            The one thing that possibly could have made that journey better though was a bed. I should have definitely booked myself a cabin in order to have a more comfortable experience but I forgot and ended up on a broken uncomfortable seat for all that exhausting journey.</p>

            </div>

            <h5 id="iv-kars" style="font-weight: bold;">IV. Kars and leaving Turkey under a snow storm</h5>
            <p>The very same night I reached <b>Kars</b> and along with me came the first and only turkish literature nobel price, <i>Orhan Pamuk</i>. He was there in order to investigate on a series of young islamic girls suicides, reported on a book called <i>Snow</i>
            and when I was reading about his experience in the city, I tried to find his marking points too. I was hosted by a student from Mauritania called Sidi, that took me out with his student fellows for a sunday afternoon tea and it was somehow nice to be back into student life, even if it was
            only for an afternoon.
            The crew was very social and very international, most of the people were from Africa or Middle East and I think overall they felt pretty well welcomed in the country as foreign students.</p>

            <p>Leaving Kars otherwise was not easy. This are the notes I took while still being there:
            "I am still here but I hope I will manage to leave soon. I am left with no cash and no internet on my phone in a very modest, dusty and overpacked bus station that does not take card
            and that is why I missed my first bus. In order to jump on the next and last one for the day, in about 3 hours I have to relocate to another bus station out of town and in order to do that I started to walk around in search of a taxi driver and after a while I found one who said he can do it for 100 liras, basically all I have left in my pocket.
            The taxi driver takes me accidentally back to the station where I was first and I start to lose my temper, having to face the same folks that refused to take my card just half an hour before.
            It starts to snow and I am completely unprepared for that weather. I thought Turkey was a warm country but once you go east, everything is completely different. I jumped back on the same taxi and the man wants to charge me double now and since I have no cash with me, I decide I will pay for the petrol of his car.
            I get out of the car, talk to the man working at the petrol station and I suddendly find myself tanking a taxi in Kars, one of the most remote corner of eastern Turkey, and that feels unreal. Once the taxi is filled, the driver looks a bit more relaxed and somehow happy with the deal. He takes me to station number two, 
            a bit more than 15 km out of town, without any other sort of misunderstandment, except from the fact that once I get there, I notice that I have just reached an abandoned empty building.
            The only thing I can spot from there, are a bunch of local people sitting in circle inside a very small house, around a fireplace. They say the bus isn't running from there anymore and I feel this nightmare is never gonna end.
            The place from where I am now supposed to catch my bus, it is another petrol station nearby and in order to reach it, I have to jump on another taxi and pay extra 150 liras.
            I have no cash left at all except from the last 100 liras I still have in my pocket and I try to make those folks understand my situation but all efforts seem useless. I gave them all my money and luckily they decide to take me to the actual bus stop and even call the bus company to tell them that there is one more damn passenger
            to pick up and give them the address of the point where they will find me.
            I am then welcomed to another small room and offered a cup of tea. After sometime a man working there comes out and starts to talk to me and tells me to walk to the next petrol station, a bit further down the road, because once again the pick up point is not clearly the exact one.
            I am walking along a turkish highway under stormy snowy weather and suddendly three huge trucks carrying tanks pass me by, covered with a huge black plastic blanket, immense as the dark force of war.
            I start to wonder about how does it feel to be there on the spot, on the battle field, standing under the snow all by yourself, with your feet wet and see those ancestral monsters moving around and spitting fire with their baritonal voice.
            It must feel like something too big to understand for a human, something that also nature can not explain."</p>
