            <p>Jordan was the first time I put a foot into the middle east and its whole complex mess, despite of the fact that the country has been living a peaceful time atleast in the recent years.
            The roman ruins of Jericho, the Jordan river, the Dead Sea and Petra were the highlights of my trip.</p>

            <p>The Nabataeans were ancient nomadic Arab people, an independent civilization based in nowadays Jordan between 400BC - 200BC. They were annexed into the Roman Empire in 106AD and consequently
            they converted to Christianity.
            The kingdom of Petra, capital of the Nabataeans, was built around 100BC and included a population of 20.000 people. Despite the roman annexation, Petra was a very important trading center until
            it suffered an earthquake in 363AD.
            It became popular in the west after a swiss traveler, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, rediscovered it in 1812 and has been seen today as one of the 7 Wonders of the World.</p>
