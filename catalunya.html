            <p>Catalunya was like coming back home. I spent one year of my life there working as bartender and haven't been back ever since.
            The initial plan of the '22 was to go to Mexico or Colombia but I had to postpone the trip mostly because travelling guidelines were still not clear after the pandemic and to be
            honest I was also short on money.
            Therefore I decided for Catalunya and instead of visiting only Barcelona, I added some extra stations to my journey (Sitges, Girona, Tarragona) where I had the chance to hike
            at the beginning of the Pyrenees region, despite of the fact that February is probably not the best month for hiking in most of Europe.
            </p>

            <p>Montjuic and Tibidabo were inspiring as usual and despite of the anxiety for the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, I tried to do the best out of my journey and enjoyed
            the simple pleasure of walking. I have also visited Merbey√©, the bar where I used to work and enjoyed a few pints with the bartender who's currently running the place.
            Certain places never changes and I wish that place could express itself at his best maybe including the local jazz scene.</p>

            <p>For this trip I brought back a novelist that I previously read during my studies in UK, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. "Hundred Years of Solitude" is a masterpiece of the literature of the twenty century,
            a must-read, a main reference of colombian magical realism and many more other things at the same time. The book talks about many topic, colonialism, progress, war, economy and family relations and it 
            covers the life of seven generations of people in their struggle to survive.</p>
