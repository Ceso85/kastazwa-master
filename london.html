                <p>Writing about London has a lot to do about writing about myself and these almost 20 years since I left my little hometown in the Alps to go and seek stories of others out here and to write my own.</p>
                
                <p>London in 2005 and then London in 2015 and 2022 is not the same but keeps its unique essence that people that have lived there have left.
                I could write a full fictionary book of unique inspiring characters that I met during that six months living in a modest hotel in Bayswater that
                probably taught me something in a world that was still not so technically connected and developed and finding a so multicultural universe was something
                definitely not easy to find. Rent was due week by week despite of the fact that certain ones were there for decades.
                Italy, France, Spain, Brasil, Mexico, Hungary, Japan, Australian, England and UK were some of the countries you could find and Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones,
                Beatles, Ramones, Sex Pistols and Black Sabbaths was the music coming out from the rusty speakers.</p>
    
                <p>Hyde Park, Notting Hill, Camden Town and Kentish Town were some of the places were we use to hang out. Brixton was still not
                what it is nowadays and other areas like Brick Lane were still mostly unknown (atleast for me).</p>
    
                <p>That place like many others in the city does not exist anymore, it has been eaten by the frenetic city rhythm and the gentrification and I guess
                most of those people live elsewhere nowadays, probably went back to their own countries or somewhere else in the world.</p>
    
                <p>Coming back 10 years after and one more time last year was the occasion for me to do my own walking tour, walking around those that
                use to be familiar districts and somehow still are. People standing on a ladder in speaker's corner to talk about whatever comes in their mind or sitting in Hampstead
                looking at the pond, looking at the same picture that was on my english book in secondary school, belongs to my own London.</p>
    
                <p>Camden Town also hasn't changed that much but nowadays for some reason I prefer the area on the south of the Thames, in places like Clapham, Camberwell or Peckham,
                since it is mostly new to me and it seems it has a sort of undiscovered potential.</p>
    
                <p>I will definitely write more about what was London before I was there for me first time. I want to write about how beautiful is Ophelia lying on water or
                about the swinging London or how the city was bombed during WW2 and what was left standing. I also want to talk about Bristol, Bath, Oxford and other places I had the chance
                to visit, but for the moment I stop here, eager to go back again in less than two months.</p>
