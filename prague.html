            <p>November is an hard month in the cold and foggy Berlin, therefore I decided to take a short break and go to Czech Republic
            for a weekend to visit my dear friend Chris. It has been a while since my last time in Prague and it has been even
            longer since my first visit as a broke wanderer in 2014 when I went for a small Euro trip including Slovakia and Austria.</p>

            <p>The best memories from the first time were including Franz Kafka, the Prague Orloj and czech pilsner beer
            above all. <b>Franz Kafka</b> is one of the most inspiring, deep and expressive writers of the XX century. His short, modest
            and partly boring routinary life that made him look like an ordinary human being despite his extraordinary imaginative mind and his strong 
            anxiety and insecurity which transpires from his writings are the peculiarities of a literally genius that had a strong influence on myself and my music, since some of
            my songs, one in particular ("You can find me in the Air"), are inspired by his tales. Back those days Prague was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, therefore
            Kafka wrote mostly in german. Who knows if all the bureaucracy that was part of his habits and that was reflected in his writings might have
            been influenced by the language he used to write too. Most of Kafka literally production, about the ninety percent, was burned by himself
            because of his low self-consideration and lack of self-esteem.</p>

            <p>The <b>Prague Orloj</b> is an astronomical clock in the old town of Prague. The clock was built in the XV century and somehow still has a very technological advanced designed
            (just to make it clear, America by that time was not discovered yet). The clock shows many different topic, also represented in most of the panteistic religions, like the sun and the moon
            and of course death, represented by a skeleton. There is also a sign of Christianism represented by the 12 wooden apostles. Despite an attempt of the Nazi to destroy it, this beautiful
            masterpiece is still standing there, more than 600 years after its first appearance.</p>

            <p>Czech people are the biggest beer consumers pro capita in the world and this is something that definitely has an impact on the czech society too.
            <b>Pilsner beer</b> was first brewed in the Czech Republic and it takes its name from the city of <i>Plzen</i>. To make it simple a <i>Pils</i> is  a pale lager beer aged with
            cool fermented yeasts in caves. The peculiarities of this type of beer are the light and bitter taste and the light colour.</p>
