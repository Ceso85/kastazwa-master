            <p>When I first met Dario, she was sitting in the busy lounge room of an hotel in Cappadocia carved into tuff, where most of the guests
            (us included) were staying mostly for a short period of time, long enough to visit the beautiful Goreme and its surroundings.
            Her particular attention to details, the cure that she had for her outfit and her ancestral appearance had a certain fascination on
            me and I decided that I wanted to get to know about her story. In the next couple of days, we had the chance to 
            spend some time together and go hiking. I was very much interested in her tales about the native land and the food culture, 
            the Inca empire and the pre-incas culture.</p>

            <p>Honestly <b>Perú</b> was initially not even on my travel list. The danger of Colombia, the night life, the street culture and the music scene
            always attracted me the most but also because of that random encounter, I decided I was going to prolong my stay in South America and visit one more
            country (that at the end turned out to be two, because due to my self-imposed-flexible ban on flying when I travel, I couldn't avoid entering Ecuador).</p>

            <p>So first of all I decided how to get into the country. After a bit of planning I chosen to avoid the coast road, since I heard Mangora
            is supposed to be quite a turistic place, surrounded by surfers and maybe not exactly the thing I was looking for in that occasion.
            I decide then to take the inside way, another rough and long journey through the jungle that lasted almost the whole day, from Vilcabamba to Jaen.
            I was heading to <b>Chachapoyas</b>, "chacha" for the locals, a nice city in the north-eastern part of Perú where I saw the first beautiful ruins
            of a precolombian local culture, after having ventured up to 3000m on a cable car, challenging my <i>vértigo</i> fear. The site is called <b>Kuelap</b> and if you find 
            yourself in that part of the world, there is definitely a place  worth to visit.</p>

            <p>The next archeological magical site I had the chance to experience it was <b>Chan Chan</b> and it is located in Trujillo, Pacific coast of Perú,
            not close to <i>Chacha</i> at all. There I got to know the brutality of the <i>Chimú</i> culture, the respect, fear and obsession they had for mother nature and for the
            a natural phenomena called <i>El Nino</i>, that took them to the point of sacrifying young local virgins in order to mitigate the heavy rains that would have killed the whole harvest.</p>

            <img src="images\perú_3.jpg" alt="perú_3" class="my-5 blog">

            <p>The southern you go in the country, the closer you get to the majestic Inca former capital of <b>Cusco</b>, an amazing place that nowadays changed drastically
            becoming more cosmopolitan but without losing its flair, where travellers like to make their own base for the time they are there to visit the <b>valle Sagrado</b>
            and all the attractions this valley has to offer.</p>

            <img src="images\perú_4.jpg" alt="perú_4" class="my-5 blog">

            <p>The main ones are of course the ruins of <b>Macchu Picchu</b> that if visited with a certain spirit of self-sacrifice (which includes a never-ending number
            of steps and a cruel wake up call at 4am) can still give a certain pleasure and sense of autenticity, despite the mass tourism.
            My suggestion is to go up as much as possible, to the peak of <b>Huaynapicchu</b> and look down from there. Macchu Picchu was never conquered by the spanish and
            somehow still looks the way it was, with its attitude to embrace the sun, a vital burning spot in the sky for the Inca that has been celebrated every year ever since during the <b>Inti Raymi</b>
            Cusco's local street festival.</p>
