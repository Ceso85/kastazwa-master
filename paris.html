                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">I. Introduction</h5>

                <p>The new year has started with a trip to <b>Paris</b> after twelve years since the last time I visited it. 
                It was one of the few times I went there purely as a visitor, since in the past I lived in the city 
                in different stages of my life, first in 2006, living out of temporary evening jobs, going to bed late at night and waking up early 
                in the morning to attend the <i>"Verlaine language school"</i> on the other side of the city, in the beautiful and friendly <b>Butte aux Cailles</b>.
                Back then <b>Père Lachaise</b> was my first parisian headquarter and the hang outs at night in the <i>20 arrondissement</i> when I was occasionally
                free from work are still marked in my memories.</p>
        
                <p>After I left the city six months after, I moved back to Paris again in 2012, this time for different reasons while writing my dissertation on <b>George Orwell</b>, feeling like my life had so much in common
                with the one of the author of <i>Down and Out in Paris and London (1933).</i> Back those days I was working as a nightwatcher in a luxurious hotel near the
                <i>place the Clichy</i> and I was living in the <i>Batignolles</i> area. Once all the check-ins were done and the service was ready for the day after, 
                I enjoyed reading Celine and falling asleep watching National Geographic while at work.</p>
        
                <p>During this last visit I stayed in the studio flat of a friend in <b>Montparnasse</b>, sleeping on her couch between various kind of art-works, mostly sculptures.
                In the meantime my interests have changed a little.</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">
                    
                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">II. les Nymphéas</h5>

                <p>Is the beauty and the stillness of nature also a filter to apply to our own 
                inner ecosystem or must nature be purely represented the way it is shown? 
                <b>Monet</b> <i>les Nymphéas</i> is one of his masterpieces and probably the one that more than any other
                painting tries to answer the question. The series of paintings is characterized by the 
                number (250 pieces) and the size of the paintings. 
                Monet is one of the most famous painters of his generation and 
                <b>Impressionism</b> was named because of one of his paintings 
                (<i>Impression, soleil levant 1872 musée Marmottan Monet</i>). 
                The works were made while the painter suffered from cataracts, affecting
                the perception of light and the colors and therefore the perception of the outside world. 
                In fact, one of Monet's ambition in relation to the countryside was to capture the changing of light and the change of time.</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">
            
                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">III. The father of us all</h5>

                <p>One of the most common features that distinguished Cezanne and Renoir was how they deal 
                with shape. While the first was more rigorous in his works preferring a more geometric 
                approach, the second focus more around harmony, preferring round shapes. 
                <b>Cezanne</b> is considered a post-impressionist painter, a movement that tries to distance 
                itself from impressionism, disregarding the emphasis on nature and preferring a more 
                symbolic/abstract vision. <b>Post-impressionism</b> can also be seen as an extension of impressionism 
                and a movement that led towards Cubism. Cezanne himself was seen as an innovator who contributed 
                in taking painting towards avantgarde according to some of the most relevant painters of the XIX/XX 
                century like Matisse or Picasso.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">IV. Renoir</h5>

                <p>Renoir’s paintings are maybe mostly associated with the feminine figure and the 
                lifestyle of a very vibrant Paris in the second half of the XIX century. 
                <i>Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (1876, musée d’Orsay)</i> is one of the pictures that 
                I personally associate most with the city of Paris, the Belle Epoque and the pleasure of 
                living those days.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">V. Struck down by death in the moment of glory</h5>

                <p>Paul Guillaume was an inexperienced art dealer born in Paris and raised in a modest 
                background. His interest for african art and sculpture started when he accidentally came 
                across an african art statue inspecting a shipment of rubber from tyres and it is one 
                of the things that distinguished him the most between art dealers, placing african art 
                into modernism.</p>

                <div>
                    <img src="images\paris_2.jpg" alt="paris_2" class="my-5 vlog">
                </div>

                <p><b>Modigliani</b> was an italian/sephardic jewish sculptor born from a wealthy family who soon 
                fell into bankruptcy in Livorno. His interests towards painture and the avantgarde brought 
                him to Paris in 1906 where he started to squat in a commune in Montmartre. Between the main 
                things that brought together Guillaume and Modigliani there is a common interest from african 
                art that probably led Guillaume to suggest his friend to focus more on painture rather than sculpture. 
                Eventually Guillaume will become Modigliani art dealer helping him to reach a certain success but 
                the interest was reciprocal and can be seen in some of Modigliani’s Guillaume portraits, where he 
                defines his friend as <i>“novo pilota”</i>.
                Modigliani, despite being a heavy drinker, suffered from tuberculosis from a young age and had health
                issues during most of his life which affected his artwork and the way he sees life.</p>

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">VI. Verlaine, Mallarmé, Prévert, Vian et Gainsbourg</h5>

                <p><b>Boris Vian</b>, a parisian musician, poet, writer and actor was a clear reference for 
                Lucien Ginsburg aka <b>Serge</b>, one of the french biggest personality in the history 
                of french music, who mostly took inspiration from french poetry and classical music 
                (mainly Chopin) of the XIX century and bring all his art, his <i>savoir-faire</i> and his rebellious, 
                self-destructive character to a more popular level. Vian, as musician, was very much 
                inspired by jazz music and so was Gainsbourg. <i>Les feuilles mortes</i>, a french song written 
                by Prévert and Kosma, subsequently taken to a huge success as standard jazz (thanks to 
                Yves Montant) is another clear indicator of how french poetry and jazz music were going 
                along the same path during this time. Gainsbourg was eternally inspired by Prévert and 
                wrote <i>La Chanson de Prévert</i> clearly referring to the melancholic souvenir and the warm 
                colors of the autumn leaves.<p>

                </div>

                <p>Going back in time, french symbolism, a movement that rejected naturalism and realism 
                towards a more symbolic, imaginative, spiritual approach with the <i>poetes maudits</i> 
                Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé as two of the most important figures, was also a main 
                reference for <i>Gainsbarre</i> and one of his greatest success. <i>Je suis venu te dire que je m’en vais</i> 
                was written following the <i>sanglots long</i> and the <i>vent mauvais</i> of his predecessor.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">VII. Java</h5>

                <p><b>Java</b> is a dance of <i>Bal-musette</i> (a bellow-blowns bagpipe) that became famous in Paris 
                at the beginning of the XIX century. The style was adopted between Parisians and immigrants 
                that settled in the Auvergnat bars in Paris (XIX arrondissement). In particular the style takes 
                its influences from the italian <i>mazurka</i> who was seen as a form of popular dance that distanced 
                itself from more elitist forms of dance like walz. <i>Bal-musette</i> was also relevant for the development 
                of other forms of music like <i>swing-jazz.</i></p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">VIII. L'Age d’Or</h5>

                <p><b>L'Age d’Or</b> or Nouvelle Époque was a period of economic, cultural, intellectual and technological 
                prosperity that affected French society at the end of the XIX century, partially a consequence of the 
                II industrial revolution. The artistic production was rising during those years and painters like 
                Claude Monet reached the peak of their celebrity during the <i>Belle Epoque</i>. Also Paul Cezanne experienced 
                an artistic transition during these years, switching from the more traditional <i>peinture en plein-air</i> to 
                a more geometrical/symbolic approach.

                The <i>Art Nouveau</i> movement also marked its presence during these years.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">IX. les Deux Magots</h5>

                <p>Apollinaire, Prévert, Hemingway, Breton, Sartre, de Beauvoir and the <i>poetes maudits</i> are only some 
                of the artists who attended <i>les Deux Magots</i> during the years. The place switched from surrealism to 
                existentialism and was seen as the center of parisian cultural life in the XX century.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-start mx-5">

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">X. Les Flâneur</h5>

                <p>The concept of <b>Flâneur</b> as a city wanderer, as somebody who the only aim is to gain awareness of what surrounds him, is something brought
                up for the first by <b>Charles Baudelaire</b>. The concept is a sort of an ode to movement, to walking, to the one who sees life as
                a sort of constant pilgrimage made in order to trascend the reality and understand the eternity. I bet in a certain way a flâneur can be seen
                as the artist himself. Kipling use to say that there are two kind of people in the world, those that stay at home and those that do not, those who belong to
                a certain place and those that are homeless but they feel at home everywhere and definitely
                Baudelaire's flâneur belongs to the second category.</p>
